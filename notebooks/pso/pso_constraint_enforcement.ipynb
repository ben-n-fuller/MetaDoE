    "In general, there are three types of constraints:\n",
    "- Constraint repair\n",
    "- Penalty methods\n",
    "- Feasibility-preserving operations\n",
    "\n",
    "From an implementation standpoint, constraint repair takes the updated particles at time $t$ and applies some function that modifies the particle positions to be enforce feasibility. Penalty methods instead modify the computed objective score after the particle position update as a function of the new positions and the constraints. Finally, feasibility-preserving operations overload the algebraic operations (addition and multiplication) to guarantee feasibility (e.g., using the Aitchison geometry to enforce sum-to-one constraints).
